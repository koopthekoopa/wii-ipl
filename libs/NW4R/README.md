# NintendoWare for Revolution (IPL version; NW4IPL)
A decompilation of NintendoWare for Revolution (NW4R) from the Wii Menu.   
   
This version of NW4R is a bit unique compare to other applications using the library (hence is why it is called the IPL version)
- It is a mix of NW4R 2006 and 2007 or above.
- Asserts seem to have been replaced with the `Error#004` screen.
