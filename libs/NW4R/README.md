NintendoWare for Revolution
===========================
A decompilation of NintendoWare for Revolution (NW4R) from the Wii Menu.  

The NW4R build since System Menu 4.0 included asserts, but they were all replaced with the `Error#004` screen.  
This NW4R build would later be used for `NW4HBM` (a variant of NW4R for the HOME Menu in channels and disc games)

The Wii Menu has the following libraries linked:
* **DB** (Debug library; for crash handler)
* **MATH** (Math utilities library)
* **UT** (Utilities library)
* **SND** (Sound Library; for ".brsar" files)
* **LYT** (Layout Library; for ".brlyt" files)
