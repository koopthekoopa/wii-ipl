# NintendoWare for Revolution (IPL version; NW4IPL)
A decompilation of NintendoWare for Revolution (NW4R) from the Wii Menu.   
   
This version of NW4R is a bit unique compare to other applications using the library (hence is why it is dubbed the IPL version)
- It seems to be a mix of NW4R 2006 and 2007 or above.
- Every assert message were replaced with the `Error#004` screen.
