NintendoWare for Revolution (IPL version; NW4IPL)
=================================================
A decompilation of NintendoWare for Revolution (NW4R) from the Wii Menu.  
   
This version of NW4R is a bit unique compare to other applications using the library (hence is why it is dubbed the IPL version)
- It seems to be a mix of NW4R 2006 and 2007 or above.
- Every assert message were replaced with the `Error#004` screen.  

The Wii Menu has the following libraries linked:
* **DB** (Debug; for crash handler)
* **MATH** (Math utilities)
* **UT** (Utilities; mostly used for NW4R libraries)
* **SND** (Sound Library; for ".brsar" files)
* **LYT** (Layout Library; for ".brlyt" files)
