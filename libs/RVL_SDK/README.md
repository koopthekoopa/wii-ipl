Revolution SDK Decompilation
============================
A decompilation of the Revolution SDK (RVL_SDK) from the Wii Menu.  

This version of the SDK is a mess.  
Seems to be an SDK version from 2006 with lazily copied code from later versons and was (mostly) recompiled with the GC 3.0a5.2 compiler.

The Wii Menu has the following libraries linked (alphabetical order):
* **AI** (Audio Interface Library)
* **ARC** (Archive Library; for reading "U8 files")
* **AX** (Audio Library)
* **AXFX** (Audio Effects Library)
* **BASE** (PowerPC architecture Library)
* **BTE** (BroadCom's Bluetooth Driver Library)
* **CARD** (GameCube Memory Card Library)
* **CNT** (Title Content API Library)
* **CNTCACHE** (Unknown)
* **CX** (Compression Library)
* **DB** (Debug Library)
* **DSP** (DSP Library)
* **DVD** (DVD Drive Library)
* **ENC** (Character Encoding Library)
* **ES** (Private ES Library)
* **ESP** (Public ES Library)
* **EUART** (Externel Interface Bus UART Library; by Hudson Soft)
* **EXI** (Externel Interface Bus Library)
* **FA** (File Allocation Library; for SD Card. Small left overs for USB support?)
* **FS** (NAND ISFS Library)
* **GX** (Graphics Library)
* **IPC** (IPC Driver and IOS Library)
* **KBD** (Keyboard Library)
* **KPAD** (High Level Wii Remote Library)
* **KPR** (Key Processor Library)
* **MEM** (Memory Manager Library)
* **MTX** (Matrix and Vector Library)
* **NAND** (NAND Library; Wii System Memory)
* **NUP** (Wii NUS Library; **N**intendo **UP**dater?)
* **OS** (Operating System Library)
* **PAD** (GameCube Controller Library)
* **RSO** (RSO Module Library)
* **SC** (System Configuration Library)
* **SCUTIL** (System Configuration Utility Library)
* **SDI** (SD Card Driver API)
* **SI** (Serial Interface Library)
* **TPL** (Texture Pallete Library)
* **USB** (IUSB I/O API; written by Hudson Soft)
* **USBUTIL** (USB Utilities)
* **USBKBD** (USB Keyboard)
* **VI** (Video Interface Library)
